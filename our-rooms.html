                            brought you to real jungles!
                            Everything is strange, poisoned and willing to kill you here. Now you are in a hunter's
                            house
                            but
                            it's
                            not
                            safe here.
                            Can you find your way out from the killing jungles? You better hurry - it's a life-or-death
                            matter.
